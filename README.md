# Imbalance-Classification-Hybrid-Sampling
Imbalanced classification hybrid sampling combines oversampling (e.g., SMOTE, Gaussian KDE) and undersampling (e.g., Tomek Links, NearMiss) to balance class distributions. It reduces bias, enhances model learning, and improves performance in noisy datasets.
